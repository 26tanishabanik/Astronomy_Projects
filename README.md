# Astronomy_Projects

This repo contains the astronomy related projects carried out during summer of 2022

 -  The Celestial Mechanics PPT is part of my internship done at SSERD (Society for Space Education Research and Development) under the topic:
**"To study the variation of the orbital parameters other than e, a,b and T; like inclination, anomalies etc in different planetary systems and carry out comparative analysis."** This project consisted of analysing the various parameters of planets and compare them across various star systems via statistical analysis and visual graphs
 - The GSOC Proposal for ML4SCI was a research based project on the topic: **"Thermonuclear Supernova Classification via their Multi-Wavelength Signatures"**. This proposal consists of understanding concepts of supernova, data analysis and ML Models for predicting the classes of supernovae.
